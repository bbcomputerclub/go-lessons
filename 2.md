# 2: Flow Control

## `if` statements
In Go, `if` statements look like this:

```go
if someCondition {
  fmt.Println("Doing something!")
}
```

where `someCondition` is a `bool`.

## `for` loops
In Go, all loops are condensed into one: the `for` loop.

To loop forever, use `for` on its own:
```go
for {
  fmt.Println("This will print forever")
}
```

To loop while a condition is true, use `for` with one expression:
```go
for someCondition {
  fmt.Println("someCondition is true")
  // do stuff
}
```

The classic `for` loop also exists:
```go
for i := 0; i < 100; i *= 2 {
  fmt.Println("i=" + fmt.Sprint(i))
}
```
The above code is roughly the same as
```go
i := 0
for i < 100 {
  fmt.Println("i=" + fmt.Sprint(i))
  i *= 2
}
```
### `break`
Use `break` to break out of a loop early.

### `continue`
Use `continue` to skip to the next iteration of a loop.

## `switch` statement
The switch statement compares a value to other values. It is essentially a lot of `if` statements strung together.

The code

```go
switch age {
  case 0:
    fmt.Println("You are an infant")
  case 1,2:
    fmt.Println("You are a toddler")
  default:
    fmt.Println("You used to be a toddler and maybe still act like one")
}
```

is the same as

```go
if age == 0 {
  fmt.Println("You are an infant")
} else if age == 1 || age == 2 {
  fmt.Println("You are a toddler")
} else {
  fmt.Println("You used to be a toddler and maybe still act like one")
}
```
