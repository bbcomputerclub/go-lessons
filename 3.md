# 3: Functions & Packages
## Functions
A function is declared with the following syntax:

```go
func generateBio(name string, age uint) string {
  // do stuff
}
```

### `return`
To return a value use `return`:

```go
return "Hello! My name is " + name + ". I am a " + fmt.Sprint(age) + "-year-old."
```

## Packages
A package is essentially a library.  
Code for the same package can be in different files but must be in the same folder.  
The `main` package is a special kind of package; it's an executable, not a library.  
The `main` package must have a `main` function.

The package declaration must be the first declaration in a file. Comments are the only thing that can precede it.

```go
package main
```

### Exported vs Unexported
Variables, constants, functions, etc. inside of a package can only be accessed from outside the package if its name starts
with a capital letter. That's why all of the functions in the standard library start with an uppercase letter (e.g. `fmt.Println`
instead of `fmt.println`) because if it didn't start with an uppercase letter the `main` package wouldn't be able to access it.
