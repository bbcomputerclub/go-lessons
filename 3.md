# 3: Functions & Packages
## Functions
A function is declared with the following syntax:

```go
func generateBio(name string, age uint) string {
	// do stuff
}
```

The `generateBio` function declared above takes 2 parameters, a `string` and an `uint`, and returns a `string`.

### `return`
To return a value use `return`:

```go
func generateBio(name string, age uint) string {
	return "Hello! My name is " + name + ". I am a " + fmt.Sprint(age) + "-year-old."
}
```

### Multiple return values
A function can return mutliple values.

```go
func createPerson() (string, uint) {
	// do stuff...
	return "Carmen", 15
}
```

Assignment with mutliple values looks like so:

```go
// ...
name, age := createPerson()
// or
name, age = createPerson()
// ...
```

### `defer`
In a function, you can `defer` a function call to move it to the end of the function.

### Varardic Functions
You can create a function that takes any number of parameters.

```go
func countInBoxes(what string, numbers ...uint) {
	fmt.Println("counting " + what + " in boxes...")
	for _, number := range numbers {
		fmt.Println("found a box with " + fmt.Sprint(number) + " " + what)
	}
}
```

Inside of `countInBoxes`, `numbers` acts like a `[]uint`.

Here's how to call that function:
```go
countInBoxes("toys", 2, 3, 5, 7)
```

## Packages
A package is essentially a library.  
Code for the same package can be in different files but must be in the same folder.  
The `main` package is a special kind of package; it's an executable, not a library.  
The `main` package must have a `main` function.

The package declaration must be the first declaration in a file. Comments are the only thing that can precede it.

```go
package main
```

### Exported vs Unexported
Variables, constants, functions, etc. inside of a package can only be accessed from outside the package if its name starts
with a capital letter. That's why all of the functions in the standard library start with an uppercase letter (e.g. `fmt.Println`
instead of `fmt.println`) because if it didn't start with an uppercase letter the `main` package wouldn't be able to access it.
