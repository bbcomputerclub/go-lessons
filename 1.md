## 1: Builtin Types, Variables, and Constants
### Builtin Types
Go's string type is called `string`.
```go
string
```

Go has two kinds of integer types: unsigned and signed.  
Signed integer types start with `int` and can be negative. Unsigned types start with `uint` and can't be negative.  
The number represennts the size of the integer. If you don't know what to use, just stick with `int`.
```go
// signed
int
int8
int16
int32
int64

// unsigned
uint
uint8
uint16
uint32
uint64
```

Go's boolean type (`true` or `false`) is `bool`.

```go
bool
```

Go has two floating-point types. Floating-point types represent real numbers (that can be non-integral). If you don't know which one to use, stick to `float64`.
```go
float32
float64
```

Go has two [complex types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number). If you don't know which one to use, stick to `complex128`.
```go
complex64
complex128
```

## Variables
Variables are declared like so:

```go
var name string
```

and modified like so:

```go
name = "Bob"
```

Go provides a way to do both at once:

```go
var name string = "Bob"
```

If you're initializing (setting a value) at the same time as you're declaring the variable, you can leave out the type:

```go
var name = "Bob"
```

Go provides another shortcut for doing this:

```go
name := "Bob"
```

Note the difference between `:=` and `=`. `=` merely assigns something to a variable, while `:=` declares *and* assigns.

## Constants
Constants are like variables but constant.

```go
const pi = 3.1415926535
const hydrogenAtomicNumber uint = 1
```

Unlike variables, constants must be initialized when declared.

```go
const age // error
```
