## 1: Builtin Types, Variables, and Constants
### Builtin Types
Go's string type is called `string`.
```go
string
```

Go has two kinds of integer types: unsigned and signed.  
Signed integer types start with `int` and can be negative. Unsigned types start with `uint` and can't be negative.  
The number represennts the size of the integer. If you don't know what to use, just stick with `int`.
```go
// signed
int
int8
int16
int32
int64

// unsigned
uint
uint8
uint16
uint32
uint64
```

Go's boolean type (`true` or `false`) is `bool`.

```go
bool
```

Go has two floating-point types. Floating-point types represent real numbers. If you don't know which one to use, stick to `float64`.
```go
float32
float64
```

Go has two complex types. [TODO]
```go
complex64
complex128
```
